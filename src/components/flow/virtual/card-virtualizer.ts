/**
 * WHICH CARDS HAVE THEIR CONTENTS IN THE DOM.
 *
 * Every card of a plan keeps its React Flow node wrapper and a fixed-size shell, but the card's contents (the
 * clean card is 48-65 elements) are mounted only for the cards on or near the screen: at 1,000 cards that is 190k
 * elements down to the 15k the performance budget allows (docs/design/backport/spec-performance.md, 6 and 10.4).
 *
 * This file is the pure part: a spatial index over the published card boxes (flow space, never the DOM), the set
 * of mounted cards, and the rules for who is in it.
 *
 * - IN: a card whose box meets the camera's rectangle grown by `margin` of its size on every side, the nearest
 *   `cap` of them, a few at a time (`batch` a step) so a zoom out does not mount a hundred cards in one frame.
 * - OUT: a card leaves once it is outside the larger `keepMargin` rectangle for `releaseMs`. The gap between the
 *   two rectangles and the delay are the hysteresis: a camera parked on a boundary never flickers a card.
 * - PINNED: hovered, focused, selected, being refreshed after a change: in whatever the camera says.
 * - HELD: everything, for the image export and the screenshot panel (they photograph the whole plan).
 * - A card never drawn (a plan just opened, a card whose layout changed while it was away) is queued to be drawn
 *   once behind the near ones, the background pass: React Flow has measured its shell at the estimated size, and
 *   its real size and handles come from that one draw. A plan of a thousand cards opens as shells and fills in over
 *   a second or two, nearest the camera first, a few cards a frame, with no frame over a few milliseconds.
 * - Zoomed out to the glance step nothing is in (the shell paints the glance face) except the background pass.
 * - A card that has been drawn and is far from the screen (past `farMargin`) is FAR: its shell is hidden with
 *   `display: none`, so the browser has nothing of it to style, hit-test or layerize (a thousand positioned
 *   wrappers cost 20 ms a frame to the compositor even when nothing in them paints). React Flow ignores the
 *   zero-sized measure of a hidden card and keeps the card's size and handles. Three phases, then: 0 far,
 *   1 a shell on or near the screen, 2 the card.
 *
 * It never reads the DOM and never schedules: `step(now)` does one round of work and says whether another is
 * wanted. The controller (VirtualizationController.tsx) calls it from requestAnimationFrame.
