 * Plays the board's sounds, the mod's files by the mod's rules (`src/lib/sound/CLAUDE.md` has the table):
 *
 * - every edit by WATCHING the plan (`soundForDiff`): a card landing, a wire latching as what it carries, a drawer made,
 *   a pin, a tier, a setting. An edit that sounded for itself (undo, clone, a chip with its own voice) claims it
 *   (`claimEdit`) and the watcher stays quiet; the check waits a task so a claim made just after the edit counts.
 * - a wheel spin ticks each step, and a pin or rate wheeled plays once the wheel has been still for 500 ms (the mod's
 *   `live`).
 * - the hand's sounds (press, lift, drop, wire grab, select) from the page's events (`board-gestures.ts`).
 * - the plan starting to run (`board.running`) when a solve has it running where it did not before.
 *
 * A different plan arriving is navigation and plays nothing, and a short quiet follows it (loading machinery rewrites
 * the plan right after a switch).
