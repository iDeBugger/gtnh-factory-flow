# The overview rail and the notices bar (src/components/flow/clean/rail)

The mod's `OverviewRail`, `SpareBar`, `SparePopup` and `NoticeBar` on the website, for plan-mode boards
(`project.planMode`). A column LEFT of the board (between the item browser and the board; it folds to a 26 px
strip, kept per device in `rail-view.ts`). On those boards the right-hand `InspectorPanel` steps aside; the old
modes keep it.

- Data is pure and tested: `rail-model.ts` (totals, setters, open ports, machines from `buildMachineList`),
  `spare-model.ts` (leftovers with a choice, most upstream first, stored split first), `rail-layout.ts` (the list as
  items with tops and heights; the component draws only the slice in view), `notices.ts` (the catalogue of the UI spec
  11.2 from the solver's notes). `rail-data.ts` shares one computation per (project, solve).
- Edits go through `rail-actions.ts`: the store's own actions (one undo step each), except a spare's split while its bar
  is in hand (`previewSpare`: re-solves, no history; `endSpareDrag`: one undo step made from the project as it was
  taken, or none if the split did not move). Wheel steps are held on screen and committed once the wheel is still
  (350 ms), so a spin is one undo step.
- A control under the pointer takes the wheel unless the list was scrolled by the wheel in the last 400 ms: one
  native non-passive listener on the list (`rail-controls.tsx`, `wheelHandlerFor`). With "Scroll changes values" off
  no control takes it and the list always scrolls. An open box given `onWheelDraft` steps the text it holds, set when
  the box is let go of; given `onLive` too it sets as it goes (each step at once, typing once it rests, never an
  emptied box) and Escape calls `onRevert`. The machine count does both, as the card's box does.
- Rows hang `data-resource-row`; hovering one sets `hoveredFlowResourceKey` (the board lights the resource), a spare's
  place sets `hoveredFlowScope` on its ports. Controls stop their clicks so the row (walk to the next card that makes or
  uses the resource) never sees them.
- `NoticeBar.tsx`: `PlanNoticeSwitch` is mounted in the board's notice corner and shows the plan-mode bar
  (`PlanBoardOverlays`: notices, `SparePopupHost`, `RailTipHost`) or the classic notices. `flashNotice` puts a
  transient sentence on top for 7 s.
- `rail-tip.tsx` is the rail's own 800 ms rest-wait tooltip; swap it for the board's shared one (WP6) when that lands.
- Fonts live on spans and divs, never on a `<button>` (globals.css forces `font: inherit` on buttons); every control
  is a `div role=button`. State hangs on data attributes.
- Type is Monocraft at 10 px (`RAIL_FONT`), measured with `measureClean`; rate boxes are 44 and keys 16 (controls 62, the mod's 26% of the rail). A machine line drops its unit when it does not fit, as the mod does; names ellipsize. The rail is 234 CSS px in shell units (screen px = x the UI scale, 273.8 at the default 1.17): measure with `offsetWidth`.
- The notices ride the TOP of the board (`PlanTopNotices`, under the toolbars). A failed solve (nothing set) counts no flows. Only resource rows and spare places light the board on hover; the mod's machine lines light nothing (OverviewRail.java drawRail).
- A machine line or group click frames the card and outlines it for a second (`goToMachineCard`,
  `flow/card-flash.ts`: an attribute on the one React Flow wrapper; the colour fades in clean.css and the attribute goes
  when the fade ends, as a far card starts it only once shown; plain for a second under reduced motion; a second click
  restarts it). Resource rows and spares frame without it. Exam:
  `card-flash.test.ts`, the machine-line case in `OverviewRail.test.tsx`.
