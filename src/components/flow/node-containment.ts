/**
 * CARDS OFF SCREEN COST NOTHING TO STYLE, LAYOUT OR PAINT.
 *
 * React Flow culling is off (routes must not depend on mount state, see
 * CLAUDE.md invariant 1), so every card of a plan is in the DOM and, without
 * this, the browser styles, lays out, layerizes and hit-tests all of them on
 * every frame: a 1,000-card plan is 190,000 elements and a zoom frame took
 * 1.2 s. `content-visibility: auto` lets the browser skip the contents of
 * the cards the camera cannot see while the nodes stay mounted, so React Flow
 * keeps its measured boxes and the router its published geometry.
 *
 * What makes it safe, and what this file does about each:
 *
 * - A skipped card keeps the box it had when it was last drawn
 *   (`contain-intrinsic-size: auto W H`), but a card that was NEVER drawn
 *   would take the fallback W H and React Flow would measure that. So a card
 *   is marked (`data-cv`, the attribute the CSS hangs off; React owns
 *   className) only once it has been laid out, with its own size as the
 *   fallback. The sweep reads every box first and writes after, so it is one
 *   layout however many cards there are.
 * - Paint containment clips; `overflow-clip-margin` (node-containment.css)
 *   leaves room for the selection ring and the halos. Hovered, selected,
 *   dragged and focused cards are exempt, so menus and hover panels that
 *   leave the card are never clipped.
 * - Nothing may read a skipped card's inner geometry: the contents have no
 *   boxes. `isCardSkipped` is for the readers that would (the slot
 *   measurement in FactoryFlow.tsx); `holdCard` drops the skip for a frame
 *   for a caller that has to measure.
 *
 * `localStorage["gtnh-factory-flow.no-cv"] = "1"` turns it off (A/B, bugs).
